They’re an extremely impressive first effort from the company, but with several features still in the “coming soon” column, it feels like they were rushed.In this video review, I go deeper into what Sonos got right with the Ace and what still needs work. There’s also a segment where I cover why these aren’t quite the magical Wi-Fi headphones that many of the brand’s most loyal customers had long dreamed of. Crucially, the Ace can’t be grouped with other Sonos speakers, but at one point, the company prototyped headphones that could.It turns out, they sucked — at least within the confines of today’s technology. This Reddit AMA post goes into more detail about the battery and CPU constraints. (The Ace have just a sliver of the CPU power compared to regular Sonos speakers, even including the Roam.) I hope we get there someday; it’d be wonderful to listen to vinyl through the Ace or have them seamlessly hand off music to my speakers when I walk through the door at home. Maybe next time.Speaking of the Roam, I’ve got a short review of the new second-gen model coming up in the days ahead. After that, I’ll finally be able to come up for air and focus on non-Sonos products for a while — until the next leak that is.0 CommentsFollow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.Chris WelchCloseChris WelchPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All by Chris WelchFeatured VideosCloseFeatured VideosPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All Featured VideosHeadphonesCloseHeadphonesPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All HeadphonesSonosCloseSonosPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All SonosSpeakersCloseSpeakersPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All SpeakersTechCloseTechPosts from this topic will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.PlusFollowSee All TechMost PopularMost PopularGoogle Pixel 10 review: perfectly fineMAGA populists call for holy war against Big TechFirst look: Dyson’s Spot+Scrub Ai robot seeks out stainsHere is Lego’s $1,000 Death Star, the most expensive Lego set everI called the MSI Claw an embarrassment, so imagine my surprise: its successor is the best Windows handheld yetThe Verge DailyA free daily digest of the news that matters most.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.
